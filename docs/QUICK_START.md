## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Notebook Won't Open?
```bash
# Install Jupyter if needed
pip install jupyter

# Or use VS Code
code complete_forest_cover_analysis.ipynb
```

### Missing Packages?
```bash
# Install all requirements
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
```

### PyTorch Not Available?
No problem! The notebook includes:
```python
try:
    import torch
    TORCH_AVAILABLE = True
except ImportError:
    TORCH_AVAILABLE = False
    print("PyTorch not available. Neural network models will be skipped.")
```
All other models will work fine!

### Out of Memory?
Reduce the dataset size in Cell 3:
```python
# Sample a subset of data
df = df.sample(n=100000, random_state=42)
```

### Presentation Won't Open?
You need Microsoft PowerPoint or compatible software:
- PowerPoint (Windows/Mac)
- LibreOffice Impress (Free)
- Google Slides (Upload online)
